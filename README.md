# Lightweight-Timer
A rust-compiled timer that focuses on being lightweight, out of the way but still easy to use. It uses the windows application manager . Its main purpose, and why it was developed, is to provide an overlay timer that can run over most applications without issues. This allows stuff like games, tasks and revision sessions to be easily monitored.
